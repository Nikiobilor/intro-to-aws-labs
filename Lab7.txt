Lab 7
Step 1
On VScode terminal navigate to directory AWSLabs and run command git pull https://github.com/awscloudessentials/intro-to-aws-lab.git
Open the new file(Lab7) in the editor, to allow you add steps you took to complete the lab.


Step 2 (Create LT)
On EC2 dashboard click on Launch Template
Create Launch template with name ASG-LT with description "Webservers for ASG"
Select Amazon linux 2 AMI
For instance type select "t2.micro"
With SG that allows SSH from 0.0.0.0/0
Paste script below under user data
#!/bin/bash
# Please make sure to launch Amazon Linux 2
yum update -y
yum install httpd -y
systemctl start httpd
systemctl enable httpd
echo "<h1>Hello World from $(hostname -f)</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
echo "<h1>Healthy</h1>" > /var/www/html/health.html

Create Launch template

Step 3 (Create  TG)
On EC2 dashboard click on Target groups
Create a target group with name ASG-TG
Leave selections as default
Add the health check path /health.html
Do not register any target instances and 
Create Target Group

Step 4 (Create ALB)
On EC2 dashboard click on Load Balancers
Select Application Load balancer , give it the name ASG-ALB
Leave selections as default (internet-facing and IPv4), select your VPC and subnets
Note the name of the SG assigned to the ALB
Select the Target group created in Step 3
Create Load balancer

Step 5 (Create ASG)
On EC2 dashboard click on Auto Scaling Groups
Give it name ASG and select the Launch Template created in step 2
Select your VPC and subnets -->Next -->Attach to an existing LB --> Select target group --> Next
For desired capacity =2
Minimum capacity = 2
Maximum capacity = 2
Under Scaling policies--> Target tracking scaling policy --> metric type -->Average CPU --> target value -->30
Next
Create Auto scaling group

STep 6 (Integration)
Verify that desired number of EC2 is launching
Modify the security group of the instances, edit inbound rules and add rule --> All traffic from the SG of the ALB
Copy the DNS name of the ALB and paste on a new webpage.
Paste screenshot (showing private IP address of instance 1)
Refresh to verify that the ALB is balancing between your 2 EC2 instances
Paste screenshot (showing private IP address of instance 2)

Step 7 (Verify ASG functionality)
SSH into one of your EC2
Run the below stress test on the instance
sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y
THEN
sudo yum install stress -y
THEN
sudo stress --cpu 2 --timeout 200

Verify that the EC2 you ran the test on is being terminated while a new EC2 is being spun up on the EC2 dashboard.
Paste screenshot
Refresh the page with the  ALB DNS name , and verify that the ALB is balancing to the new EC2
Paste screenshot (showing private IP address of new instance )

Step 8
Once confirmed, kindly clean up your AWS account.
Edit the file in VSCode editor, save and push to your personal remote repo.
